# Stratis.SmartContracts.Samples

This repository contains example Smart Contracts in C# that can be used as a reference for a application or Smart Contract that you are developing on the Stratis Platform.

These contracts can be easily deployed within your own local test network by following the documentation provided on the [Stratis Academy](https://academy.stratisplatform.com/SmartContracts/Tutorial1-LocalSidechain/local-network-tutorial-introduction.html)
